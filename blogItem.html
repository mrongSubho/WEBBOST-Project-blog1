                Digital image processing 
            </div>
            <p>In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital 
                images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog 
                image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as 
                the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) 
                digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr class="h3"></hr>
            <p>
                Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were developed
                 in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of 
                 Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, 
                 medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph enhancement. The cost of processing was fairly high, 
                 however, with the computing equipment of that era.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-img">

            </div>
            
            <p>
                That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became 
                available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as television standards conversion. 
                As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most 
                specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital 
                image processing has become the most common form of image processing and generally, is used because it is not only the most 
                versatile method, but also the cheapest.

                Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology 
                Hall of Fame in 1994.
